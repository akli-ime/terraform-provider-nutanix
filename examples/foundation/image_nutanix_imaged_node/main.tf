/*
Node is considered nutanix imaged node when:
- Node is already have cvm & hypervisor running and you want to reimage as per your requirement
- Node is having Discovery OS running and you want to image it with aos and appropriate hypervisor
This kind of nodes are discoverable from foundation using ipv6 address network discovery. You can check
response of nutanix_foundation_discover_nodes data source. This nodes can be imaged using ipmi (standalone foundation), 
example can be found in examples under foundation/image_bare_metal. Or this node can be imaged using cvm/discovery os running
on imaged node (example given below).

Description:
- Here we want to image nutanix imaged nodes using the node's cvm itself.
- ipmi_user & ipmi_password creds are not mandatory here incase node's cvm is used (by making device_installer=true in node spec).

Notes : Most information for a node can be directly pulled from nutanix_foundation_discover_nodes & nutanix_foundation_node_network_details
        datasources and can be substitued.
